This is the API that supports CRUD operations related to a Car. The API was developed in Node.js that uses Express.js. The data is saved in a MongoDB database that uses Mongoose as ORM.

## Development server

In the terminal, run `mongod` to start the MongoDB Server. This should be configured properly.

In the another terminal, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Then, run `npm run start` to run the node server that it's using nodemon. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/` to see the welcome message. 

## Postman Collection

In the `postman-collection` folder, it's located the postman collection with all requests that can be imported to Postman to test the API.
